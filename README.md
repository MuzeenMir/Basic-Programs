The Merge sort algorithm here is different, I tried to use the list properties to enhance the performance of merge sort, and it worked. 
It works much faster than common merge sort algorithms and has way lesser comparisons.
Upto 10x faster for size of 100,000 elements and upto 5x faster for 1 million elements.
With 30.72x lesser comparisons for 100,000 elements and 37.34x lesser comparisons for 1 million elements.
Insertion sort uses the common logic and is not so special.
